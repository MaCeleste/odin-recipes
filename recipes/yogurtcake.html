    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Yogurt Cake is an everyday cake. It's one that I serve as a weekday dessert or when friends come over for coffee. It has a wonderful dense and moist texture and tastes of almond, lemon, and vanilla. No one will ever guess how easy it is to make.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/4 cups (165 grams) all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/4 cup (30 grams) ground almonds</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon (4 grams) baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon (2 grams) baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon (2 grams) kosher salt</li>
        <li>Zest (outer skin) of one lemon (optional)</li>
        <li>2 large eggs (100 grams out of shell), at room temperature</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (120 ml/grams) flavorless oil (safflower, corn, vegetable, or canola)</li>
        <li>3/4 cup (180 ml/grams) whole milk plain yogurt, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon (4 grams) pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup (200 grams) granulated white sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C) and place the oven rack in the center of the oven. Butter, or spray with a non stick vegetable spray, an 8 inch (20 cm) spring form pan. Line the bottom of the pan with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, stir or whisk together the flour, ground almonds, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and lemon zest.</li>
        <li>In another bowl, stir or whisk together the eggs, oil, yogurt, and vanilla extract. Stir in the sugar. Add the wet ingredients to the dry flour mixture. Stir until just combined. Scrape the batter into the prepared pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven for about 40 to 45 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Remove from oven and place on a wire rack to cool. You can serve this cake plain or with a dollop of whipped cream, ice cream, or lightly sweetened yogurt.</li>
    </ol>
