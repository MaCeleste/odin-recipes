    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a really nice tasting scone with a crisp outer crust and a soft, almost bread-like texture. They are delicious plain, or you can serve them with butter and jam, clotted cream and jam, or even lemon curd and clotted cream or whipped cream.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups (260 grams) all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/4 cup (50 grams) granulated white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (113 grams) unsalted butter, cold and cut into pieces</li>
        <li>2/3 - 3/4 cup (160 - 180 ml) buttermilk</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) and place oven rack in middle of oven. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Cut the butter into small pieces and blend into the flour mixture with a pastry blender or two knives. The mixture should look like coarse crumbs.  Add the buttermilk and vanilla extract to the flour mixture and stir just until the dough comes together.</li>
        <li>Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead the dough gently and form into a 7 inch (18 cm) round that is about 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick. Use a 2 1/2 inch (6.5 cm) round biscuit cutter to cut the dough into circles. Transfer the scones to the baking sheet and brush the tops of the scones with a little milk.</li>
        <li>Bake for about 18-20 minutes or until golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean. Remove from oven and transfer to a wire rack to cool. Can be stored at room temperature for a few days.</li>
